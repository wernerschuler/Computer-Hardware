Key Computer Components
-- 

**Cooler - Includes a metal heat sink and a fan**
- Used to keep the system cool, preventing overheating.
- The heat sink is a metal block that absorbs heat and distributes and transfers the heat to the surrounding air.
- The fan helps maintain a steady airflow and prevents the buildup of hot air.

**GPU (Graphics processing unit)**
 - Responsible for rendering images, videos, and animations so it can be displayed on to your computer's monitor.

**CPU (Central processing unit)**
 - Responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations.
 - Responsible for running software programs and carrying out arithmetic, logic, control, and input/output operations.

**RAM (Random access memory**
 - RAM provides temporary storage.
 - Stores data and instructions that the CPU needs to access quickly.
 - Temporary storage for computer programs programs that are currently in use. When you turn off your computer the RAM gets wiped out.

**Power supply unit**
 - Takes AC power from the wall and transforms it into many different DC currents specific to each component. It is responsible for providing the necessary electrical power to run the internal components of the computer, including the motherboard, processor, memory, storage devices, graphics card, and peripherals.

**NIC (Network interface card)**
 - Allows a device to connect to a network.

**Storage, Hard disk drive/ Solid state drive**
 - Long-term memory
 - Is responsible for storing data and programs on your computer
 - Some advantages of using a Hard disk drive (HDD):
   - HDD is generally cheaper compared to an SSD.
   - HDDs are available in higher capacity, making them better for storing large amounts of data.
 - Disadvantages of using HDD:
   - Slower performance - HDDs have slower data access and transfer rates compared to SSDs
   - Higher power consumption: HDDs require more power to operate the spinning platters and moving mechanical parts, resulting in higher power consumption.
  - Advantages of using a Solid-State Drive (SSD):
    - Increased speed: SSDs offer significantly faster data access and transfer speeds compared to HDDs. This results in faster boot times, quicker loading of applications, and improved overall system responsiveness.
    - Lower power consumption: SSDs consume less power than HDDs, resulting in lower energy usage and longer battery life for laptops and portable devices.
 - Disadvantages of using an SSD. SSDs offer many advantages over HDDs but they do have some drawbacks:
   - Data Recovery: In case of a failure or data corruption in an SSD, data recovery can be more challenging compared to HDDs. While both types of drives can experience failures, data recovery is typically more feasible and cost-effective with traditional HDDs.
   - Cost: SSDs are generally more expensive per unit of storage compared to HDDs. Although prices have been decreasing over time.

**Motherboard**
 - Where other computer components can connect to. For example, it has a CPU socket, memory slots to insert the RAM, expansion slots, SATA connectors which is used to connect your storage device.
 - Allows the components to connect and communicate with each other.
